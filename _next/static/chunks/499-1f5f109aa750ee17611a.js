Kasa is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as a Recognised Market Operator in the conduct of the activity of establishing or operating an organized market regulated under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) and is a holder of a capital market services license (dealing) issued by MAS."},{"category":"About Kasa","questions":"How does Kasa protect my money and investments?","answers":"<h4>Client money</h4><br />When you fund your account at Kasa, you can be assured of the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Your money is held with a licensed custodian who in turn holds the client monies in segregated client accounts at established and regulated financial institutions such as DBS Singapore.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Your money is segregated and not co-mingled with Kasa\u2019s own money and hence Kasa does not and cannot use clients\u2019 money for its own use.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Clients\u2019 money is protected from Kasa\u2019s creditors in the unlikely event that Kasa goes into liquidation.<br /><br /><h4>Client assets</h4><br />When the money you fund at Kasa is invested through Kasa Platform, you can be assured of the following:<br />The investments are owned and held with a licensed trustee who acting in the capacity as an nominee shareholder would hold, on behalf of all Kasa\u2019s clients, the underlying investments. For example, if the investments are units held in a Collective Investment Scheme, the nominee shareholder would be the only shareholder owning all of your investments in the Scheme. Kasa has contracted the nominee shareholder, who is a licensed trustee such that it is ultimately responsible for ensuring your investments are segregated in relation to the investments it holds on an investor\u2019s behalf. This means that in the event the Kasa or the custodian is insolvent, the clients assets would be safe with the nominee shareholder as they were segregated in the first place.<br /><br /><h4>Protections offered</h4><br />Your monies and assets are segregated and not commingled with Kasa\u2019s own assets and hence Kasa does not and cannot use clients\u2019 assets for its own use.<br />Clients\u2019 assets are protected from Kasa\u2019s creditors in the unlikely event that Kasa goes into liquidation.<br />In the unlikely event of a closure, Kasa will work with its partner custodian and trustee, which hold clients\u2019 money and assets, to ensure the orderly transfer of money and assets to other licensed financial institutions or the return of all money and assets to clients."},{"category":"Getting Started","questions":"How do I sign up for an account?","answers":"To sign up, you can simply register online by clicking \u201cGet Started\u201d at Kasa website.
